#CompileLaTex

##Introduction
The CompileLaTex plug-in is an easy way to compile LaTeX using a compiler of choice and displaying the output in PDF using a PDF reader of choice.
This is only tested using xelatex and okular but should work with any LaTeX compiler and PDF reader as long as the compiler works like 
`compiler document.tex`
and the PDF reader works like
`reader document.pdf`. 
This will get tested using different compilers and readers and there will be tests written to use with Travis CI.
